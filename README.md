# Reinforcement-Learning-Assigngment
This project was a part of the module dynamic programming and reinforcement learning taught by Dr. Felipe Maldonado at University of Essex in Spring Semester 2022
The most part of the code including making a framework for the game environment and other graphing facilities have been coded by Dr. Felipe Maldonado. I just did the part of problem solving writing down the bodies of asked methods.
